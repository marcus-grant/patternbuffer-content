# Maker Basics: Capacitors

Possibly the most humble electronic component that makers will use, besides the [resistor](http://thepatternbuffer.com) which was covered in the linked article is the capacitor. If you haven't read the resistor article yet, I recommend you do so before proceeding. Capacitors, like resistors are a passive component, which basically means that they don't require external power or input to operate. Like a resistor, charge simply enters and (sometimes) leaves. More on the "sometimes" later.

### Impedance

Before we get into the practical details about capacitors which is ultimately what a maker is after, let's do a very brief overview of the theory of how it operates. Ultimately a capacitor is a passive device that introduces impedance, which incidentally, resistors do as well. The difference? Capacitors imV
