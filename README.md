# patternbuffer-content

The contents of my blog, [thepatternbuffer.com](http://thepatternbuffer.com)

Since most of my posts are written in markdown, with perhaps a few image tags here and there, most of these posts can actually be viewed here, and I will try and keep a running index of these posts below. Feel free to read, comment, suggest edits, new topics, or have fun giving me **constructive** criticism. If you want to share any article, please link back to my site, or at the very least leave me, Marcus Grant, attribution. Enjoy, live long, and prosper ðŸ––
